Abalone Gender and Interior Measurements Analysis

Overview

This project explores the Abalone dataset, performing multivariate analysis to understand the relationships between different biological measurements and predict abalone's gender and interior measurements using machine learning models.

Dataset

The Abalone dataset contains biological attributes of abalones and aims to predict their gender and interior measurements based on physical measurements.

Analysis & Methodology

The project follows these key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding feature distributions.
3. Feature Selection & Transformation: Selecting relevant variables for modeling.
4. Machine Learning Models:
   - Regression models for interior measurements
   - Classification models for gender prediction
   - Performance evaluation

Technologies Used

- R (for analysis and visualization)
- Libraries: `dplyr`, `readr`, `MASS`, `GGally`, `e1071`, `Hotelling`

Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/abalone-analysis.git
   cd abalone-analysis
   ```
2. Install required R packages:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("dplyr", "readr", "MASS", "GGally", "e1071", "Hotelling"))
   ```
3. Run the analysis using RStudio or an R notebook.
