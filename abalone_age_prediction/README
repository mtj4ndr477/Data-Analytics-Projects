Abalone Age Category Classification

Overview

This project focuses on classifying abalone based on their age using machine learning models. The goal is to predict whether an abalone belongs to one of several predefined age groups based on its physical attributes.

Dataset
The Abalone dataset contains biological measurements of abalones, with the target variable being the age category, derived from the number of rings in the shell.

Analysis & Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing
   - Handling missing values and feature transformations.
   - Converting categorical variables into numerical format.
   - Scaling numerical features.

2. Feature Engineering
   - Selecting relevant features for classification.

3. Machine Learning Models Used
   - Neural Networks (Multi-layer Perceptron - MLP)
   - Various optimizers and hyperparameters tested

4. Evaluation Metrics
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - ROC-AUC (if applicable)

Technologies Used
- Python (for data processing and modeling)
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow/keras`
